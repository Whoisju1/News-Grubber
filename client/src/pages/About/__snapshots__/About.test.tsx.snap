I&#x27;m a full stack web developer who love what he does. I&#x27;m originally from the country of Dominica, not Dominican Republic, just Dominica. It&#x27;s a very tiny Island in the Caribbean, known as the &quot;Nature Isle&#x27; of the Caribbean&quot;. It&#x27;s a very beautiful place. I moved to the US and and fell in love with programming. I took my baby steps in programming at the Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp, where I learned the basics of web development but has since built upon the foundation that was laid, through taking courses, lots of personal practice, and professional experience. I make it a goal to grow, learn something new everyday, deepening my knowledge and sharpening my skills.</p></section></article>"`;
